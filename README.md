gameofpoker
===========

A small text-based tournament of NLHE poker. The player fights three computer brains to last till the end and win nothing. Made as a platform to develop AI (which atm is very dumb) for NLHE poker. The poker-rules side of this has some issues. Doesn't need additional libraries.
