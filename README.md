gameofpoker
===========

A small text-based tournament of NLHE poker. The player fights three computer brains to last till the end and win nothing. Made to be an AI (which atm is very dumb) development platform for NLHE poker. The code may look shitty but almost everything works, and doesn't need other software ('poker libraries').
